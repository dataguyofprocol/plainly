/**
 * The question dock — a pending quiz/ask REPLACES the chat composer: the

 * the teacher's (question, options, explanation) and the learner's —
 * "Your thinking", a labeled composer-twin field for dumping reasoning,
 * with Submit docked inside it exactly like the chat composer's send.
 *
 * The thinking field is the transfer channel of the whole product (wave-2):
 * never called "optional", Enter makes a NEWLINE (it is for dumping — soon
 * dictated, not typed), submission is the button only, and its size scales
 * with the phase (probing stays quick; teaching invites depth). The
 * "Other…" option is an editable option ROW — circle + inline input,
 * styled like its siblings — so picking Other never displaces thinking.
 *
 * Collapse behavior (scroll-up → slim bar) is owned by the DockOverlay in the
 * chat view, which also owns the persistent shell and its height morph. This
 * component is content only. The expanded form stays MOUNTED while collapsed
 * (hidden, not unmounted) so a half-made selection survives scrolling.
